Design and implementation of a system for creating multimedia linked data and its applications in education 

The number of multimedia data has been constantly increasing and recently due to the popular SNS services as well as applications that run on smartphones, almost anyone can easily post video files or audio files on the Web. There are many tools by which lay users who do not have technical backrounds on the multimedia data format can create video files or audio files. While most existing tools for creating multimedia data have good user interfaces so that non-expert users can create different kinds of multimedia data easily, few tools allow users to semantically connect multimedia data so that semantics based searching can be supported. Linked data is a concrete example of the Semantic Web that aims for representing data in a form that machines can understand. In this paper, we present an easy-to-use system that helps novice users create multimedia linked data and show how the system can be used in education. The system has been implemented using open sources and all that users have to do is prepare data that need to be provided as linked data in a simple format. Then the system automatically generates multimedia linked data and a relation-based service such as RelFinder can be working with the data that the system generates.
